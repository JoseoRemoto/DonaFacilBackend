- **User Account Management**: Handling registration, authentication, and profile management.
- **Item Listing and Management**: APIs for posting, searching, and managing items.
- **Community Features**: Support for community interaction features like user ratings and messaging.
- **Security**: Implementation of robust security measures including data encryption and secure API endpoints.
- **Performance**: Optimized for high responsiveness and capable of handling a significant load with efficient database interactions.

Technologies used:

- Framework: .NET Core.
- Database: SQL Server for data persistence.
- Additional Libraries: Entity Framework for ORM, ASP.NET Core Identity for authentication.


### **App Architecture**

The backend architecture of Dona Facil is structured to ensure robustness, scalability, and maintainability. The system is developed using .NET, known for its powerful features in building high-performance, secure, and scalable applications. Below is an overview of the key architectural components:

### 1. **Layered Architecture**:

- **Presentation Layer** (not typically part of the backend, but important for context):
    - Handles HTTP requests and responses.
    - Translates between the domain models and the DTOs (Data Transfer Objects).
- **Business Logic Layer**:
    - Contains the core functionality of the application.
    - Handles business rules and validations.
- **Data Access Layer**:
    - Manages data persistence and retrieval from the database.
    - Uses Entity Framework Core for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).

### 2. **API Design**:

- **RESTful API**:
    - Exposes endpoints for frontend and mobile app integration.
    - Follows REST principles for resource-based interactions.
- **Versioning**:
    - API versioning to handle changes and updates gracefully.
- **Authentication and Authorization**:
    - JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication.
    - Role-based access control for authorization.

### 3. **Database and Persistence**:

- **SQL Server**:
    - Used for data storage, chosen for its robustness and scalability.
- **Entity Framework Core**:
    - ORM tool for handling database operations.
    - Reduces boilerplate code and improves development efficiency.

### 4. **Error Handling and Logging**:

- **Global Exception Handling**:
    - Centralized error handling for consistent response structure and easier debugging.
- **Logging**:
    - Using libraries like Serilog or NLog for comprehensive logging.

### 5. **Dependency Injection**:

- In-built support in .NET Core for dependency injection.
- Promotes a loosely-coupled and testable codebase.

### 6. **Performance and Scalability**:

- **Caching**:
    - Implementation of caching mechanisms to improve performance.
- **Asynchronous Programming**:
    - Use of async/await for non-blocking database and network calls.
- **Load Balancing**:
    - Prepared for deployment in a load-balanced environment for scalability.

### 7. **Testing**:

- **Unit Testing**:
    - NUnit or xUnit for testing individual units of code.
- **Integration Testing**:
    - Testing the integration between various components and the database.

### 8. **CI/CD Pipeline**:

- Automated build, testing, and deployment process.
- Utilizing platforms like Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions.

### 9. **Monitoring and Health Checks**:

- Implementing health checks to monitor the status of the application.
- Use of Application Insights or similar tools for performance monitoring.

### 10. **Security**:

- Ensuring security in API access.
- Implementing measures against common vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF).

### 11. **Folder Structure**:

- **Controllers**:
    - For handling API requests.
- **Services**:
    - Business logic implementation.
- **Repositories**:
    - Data access logic.
- **Models/Entities**:
    - Data models representing database tables.
- **DTOs**:
    - Objects for client-server communication.
- **Utilities**:
    - Common utilities and helpers.
